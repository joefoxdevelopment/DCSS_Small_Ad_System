# DCSS_Small_Ad_System
## Pre asignment notes
1) Package things up.

    `package JoeFox.Templates;`

    `import JoeFox.Templates.*;`

2) Core Use Cases. (Use as a core starting point)

    a. Post Advert.
    
    b. Browse Adverts.

3) Break application into separate components. Start small and work up.

4) Threads could be useful for this with different threads.

5) Wrapper class for Space Operations (MVC)

6) Do basic requirements first. At least two of the additional should be implemented, the more the merrier though.

7) An identification system would be useful. A username/password template submitted to the space indefinitely would be ideal.
